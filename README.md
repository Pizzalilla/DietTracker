# DietTracker

An iOS application built with **SwiftUI**, demonstrating **Object-Oriented** and **Protocol-Oriented** design principles, along with MVVM architecture. The app allows users to log food, track daily calories and macros, set nutrition goals, and visualize progress.

## üèó Architecture & Design

- **Models.swift**  
  Encapsulates domain logic (FoodItem, Meal, DailyLog, Goal). Uses:
  - **Composition over inheritance** ‚Üí Meals are made of FoodItems, Logs are made of Meals.  
  - **Protocols (`Trackable`, `GoalCheckable`)** ‚Üí Shared behaviours without forced class hierarchies.  
  - **Value types (`struct`)** ‚Üí Safer state management in SwiftUI.  
  - **Codable/Equatable** ‚Üí Persistence and easy testing.  

- **ViewModels/**  
  - `AppViewModel`: The single source of truth (user name, goals, logs, recents). Handles persistence.  
  - `DailyLogViewModel`: Exposes today‚Äôs log totals and handles add/remove of meals.  
  - `AddFoodViewModel`: Validates user input and builds FoodItems.  
  - `GoalsViewModel`: Manages text bindings for editing goals.  

- **Views/**  
  - `DailyLogView`: Home dashboard with calorie ring, macros grid, and today‚Äôs meals.  
  - `AddFoodView`: Presets, recents, search, and Quick Add form.  
  - `GoalsView`: Shows today‚Äôs progress vs. goals and allows editing of targets.  

- **MVVM Pattern**  
  Views are kept declarative and simple, with business logic pushed into ViewModels. Models stay dumb, focusing only on domain data and rules.

1. Open the project in **Xcode 15+**.  
2. Run the app on a simulator or device.  
3. Add food using presets, recents, or Quick Add.  
4. Adjust daily goals in the ‚ÄúGoals‚Äù tab.  
5. Relaunch the app ‚Äî all data is persisted in JSON automatically.
